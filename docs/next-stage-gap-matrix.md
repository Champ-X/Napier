# Napier Next-Stage Gap Matrix

This matrix is re-audited from the current repository before each vertical
slice. It is not a feature wishlist or a substitute for task-success
benchmarks.

## Baseline

Audit date: 2026-07-29

- The Work Ledger, replay artifacts, Plans, evaluation, recovery, and
  extension governance are substantially ahead of the execution surface.
- `apps/server/src/app.ts` and `packages/runtime/src/store.ts` remain the
  largest production modules. New execution code must stay outside both.
- The Web main entry remains subject to the 150 KiB release gate.
- General host shell execution remains unavailable.

## Priority Matrix

## Completed Slice: Read-Only Sandboxed Commands

User scenario: an Agent can run a real Node diagnostic when structured read
tools and the fixed verifier are insufficient.

Acceptance:

- explicit argv only; no user-provided shell command string;
- canonical workspace-relative cwd;
- read-only workspace and denied network capability;
- fixed secret-free environment;
- foreground output capture with independent stdout/stderr caps;
- non-zero exit, timeout, output cap, cancellation, unsupported backend,
  concurrency, and path-escape behavior covered by tests;
- command arguments and output text available to the live model but redacted
  from Ledger and Trace, with stable hashes retained for replay and loop
  detection;
- enabled through the revisioned Agent profile and visible in Context and
  Trace;
- real macOS Sandbox smoke available through `npm run test:live-command`.

Threat boundary:

- The selected runtime is an absolute allowlisted executable and is the only
  process executable admitted by the local OS sandbox profile.
- This slice does not grant workspace writes, inherited environment variables,
  networking, a PTY, background persistence, package installation, or a
  general shell.
- Wall time, output, and process-group termination are enforced. Local macOS
  and Bubblewrap adapters do not yet provide independently configured hard
  CPU/memory quotas; those remain a required managed-session or OCI follow-up.
- OCI execution is fail-closed until the executable identity observed on the
  host can be bound to the executable inside the image.
- Python and Git remain outside the runtime enum after live macOS testing
  showed their Developer Tools shims require broader transitive dependencies
  than this local slice should grant.
- An interrupted command has an unknown outcome and is not silently rerun.

Observed result:

- Unit and Agent integration tests cover success, failure, timeout, output
  cap, cancellation, concurrency, path escape, missing runtime, replay, and
  redaction.
- The live smoke completed through an independent macOS Terminal process,
  drove a scripted model through `AgentRuntime`, returned `napier@0.1.0` from
  the real sandboxed tool, and verified the Ledger redaction boundary. A smoke
  launched from inside an already sandboxed IDE process fails closed because
  macOS rejects nested `sandbox-exec`; this is an environment limitation, not
  a fallback to unsandboxed execution.

## Completed Slice: Bounded Workspace Process Sessions

User scenario: an Agent can start a longer Node diagnostic in the background,
continue reasoning, inspect new output through a cursor, and cancel the process
without receiving host shell access.

Acceptance:

- one revisioned Agent tool starts, polls, and cancels Process Sessions;
- every start uses the existing explicit-argv Node runtime preparation and the
  same read-only, offline OS sandbox boundary as `run_command`;
- active sessions expose bounded, ordered stdout/stderr chunks through local
  API and Workbench views without persisting output text in Ledger or Replay;
- per-session wall time, per-stream output, chunk count, per-Thread and
  per-Runtime active process counts, and retained-session count are bounded;
- start, success, failure, timeout, output cap, cancellation, concurrent
  polling, graceful shutdown, unsupported backend, and ownership denial are
  covered by tests;
- lifecycle events bind the owning Thread and Run, command/environment/runtime
  hashes, status, output hashes, cursors, and settlement reason;
- service restart projects an unclosed historical session as `interrupted`
  with unknown outcome and never silently reruns or reports it as completed;
- a lazy Workbench Processes panel lists status, limits, output availability,
  live output, and cancellation without adding process logic to the oversized
  Store or Server modules;
- a real macOS Sandbox smoke drives start, poll, and settlement through
  `AgentRuntime`.

Threat boundary:

- Process Sessions do not add a shell, user-selected executable, inherited
  environment, network, workspace write, package installation, or PTY.
- Output text is available only from the current local Runtime process and is
  bounded in memory. Ledger, Trace, exports, and restart recovery retain hashes
  and counts only. Output becomes unavailable after restart by design.
- Session IDs are Napier identities rather than host PIDs. A caller can inspect
  or cancel only sessions belonging to the selected Thread.
- Graceful shutdown terminates every active session before Store close.
  Abrupt host or Runtime termination can leave the local macOS wrapper outcome
  unknown because sandbox-exec has no parent-death contract; startup therefore
  records interruption rather than completion. Proved orphan termination and
  cross-restart reattachment require a managed guardian or OCI identity and are
  not claimed by this slice.
- Hard CPU, memory, and process-count quotas remain backend defaults. The
  existing wall/output bounds reduce exposure but do not replace OCI or VM
  resource isolation for hostile code.

Observed result:

- Runtime tests cover start, cursor output, success, failure, timeout, output
  cap, parent and operator cancellation, concurrent admission, Thread
  ownership, graceful shutdown, restart interruption, and Agent tool use.
- Server integration covers Thread-scoped list/output/cancel APIs and confirms
  output text is absent from durable events.
- The independent macOS Terminal smoke drove a scripted model through
  `AgentRuntime`, started a real sandboxed background Node process, observed
  `napier@0.1.0` through the cursor, settled successfully, and verified Ledger
  redaction in 457–499 ms across the initial and final reviewed revisions.
- Browser Dogfood loaded the lazy Processes panel from the live Vite/Server
  pair, verified its accessible tab selection and empty state, and reported no
  application console errors.
- Process capability code is split across execution preparation, lifecycle
  projection, Agent tool projection, and Manager modules. `agent-runtime.ts`
  is smaller than it was before this slice; Store remains unchanged.

## Completed Slice: Process Workspace Delta

User scenario: after a Process Session settles, the operator can tell whether
the workspace changed during its execution window and inspect a bounded local
file delta before trusting the result or considering broader write access.

Acceptance:

- verifier and Process Sessions share one deterministic, dependency-free
  workspace snapshot implementation;
- a pre-execution snapshot is taken before sandbox launch and a post-execution
  snapshot after process settlement and runtime identity verification;
- complete snapshots classify the delta as `unchanged` or `changed`; any
  truncated side classifies it as `indeterminate` rather than claiming safety;
- durable session evidence retains only pre/post digests, truncation state,
  changed-file count, and a changed-path-set digest;
- bounded relative paths and before/after file metadata remain available only
  from the current local Runtime through a Thread-scoped API and Workbench
  view, then become unavailable after restart;
- external concurrent changes are reported as workspace drift even though the
  sandbox itself is read-only; Napier does not falsely attribute the writer;
- failure, timeout, cancellation, output cap, shutdown, restart, concurrent
  polling, file add/modify/remove, symlink exclusion, snapshot truncation, and
  sensitive path redaction have automated coverage;
- the real macOS smoke proves an unchanged read-only session through
  `AgentRuntime`, and browser Dogfood inspects the rendered delta state.

Threat boundary:

- A pre/post comparison observes an execution window; it cannot prove which
  process caused a concurrent external change.
- Snapshot limits remain 2,000 files and 16 MiB. Truncation is fail-closed as
  `indeterminate`, and unobserved bytes are never represented as unchanged.
- `.git`, `.napier`, `node_modules`, and symlinks remain excluded. This avoids
  secret/state ingestion and link traversal, but changes inside those excluded
  roots are intentionally outside the claim.
- Relative paths are local ephemeral product data. Ledger, Trace, Replay,
  exports, and restart projections receive only counts and hashes.
- This slice does not grant workspace write permission. A later write-capable
  session still requires an explicit preflight scope and recovery design.

Observed result:

- the opt-in Agent-to-macOS-Sandbox smoke passed from an independent Terminal
  in 342 ms against a real temporary workspace and proved complete
  before/after snapshots with an `unchanged` result;
- an isolated full Server/Runtime/Store/Web dogfood created one concurrent
  external `drift.txt` write, then the Processes panel rendered
  `1 file drifted during window`, the relative path, before/after metadata, and
  the explicit non-attribution warning;
- the browser page contained no temporary absolute path and produced no console
  error;
- schema v1 Process evidence remains recoverable after an actual Store restart;
  new schema v2 evidence carries the bounded snapshot summary;
- the shared snapshot implementation retains existing verifier digest
  semantics while adding canonical confinement, symlink race defense, bounded
  local details, and fail-closed truncation.

## Next Candidate

After this slice, decide between an explicit write-session preflight/diff
workflow and a managed guardian/OCI backend. PTY and managed Python should wait
for a backend that can prove hard limits and restart ownership.
